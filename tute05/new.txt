superclass --> postcondition that output is 0 <= n <= 100
subclass --> output is 0 <= n <= 200 this is weakening



superclass function f is called in a program
we expect it to return something 0 <= n <= 100

lsp says we should be able to replace f with it's
subclass's implementation

but the subclasses implementation returns 0 <= n <= 200

so we could possible get a return of like 150

but this violates the parents postcondition

so this means that the subclass is not replaceable with teh parent 
class

which means it violates LSP





# in subclasses, preconditions can be weakened

parent class accepts anything from 0 ~ 100 as an INPUT

sub class accepts anything from 0 ~ 200 as an INPUT


    public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) 
    {
        // compare zID first
        if (s1.zID > s2.zID) {
            return 1
        } else if (s1.zID < s2.zID) {
            return -1
        }

        if (s1.userId > s2.userId) {
            
        }
                        
        int v = sa.compareTo(sb);                             
        return v;  // it can also return 0, and 1
        
    }
